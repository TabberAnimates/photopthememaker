# **Welcome to the Photop Theme Maker!**
Welcome! I suppose you stumbled apon this theme generator for photop! What's that? **You don't know how to use it?** Well then, I shall teach you how!

## Installing the Importer
The first step in this proccess is to download the importer. What you need to do is right click on the bookmarks
bar and add a page, like this:
<br> ![alt text](https://tabberanimates.github.io/photopthememaker/images/rightclick.png)

Once you're in the add page window, paste in `javascript:(function(){document.body.appendChild(document.createElement('script')).src='https://tabberanimates.github.io/photopthememaker/theme.js' })();` into the url section, like so:
<br> ![alt text](https://tabberanimates.github.io/photopthememaker/images/url.png)

And **BOOM!** You now have the theme importer :D
<br>Now we need to make a theme to use on photop.

## Making a theme
Now that you have the importer, now lets get the theme code.
<br>First off, you need to go to this website: https://tabberanimates.github.io/photopthememaker/. The page should look something like this:
<br> ![alt text](https://tabberanimates.github.io/photopthememaker/images/codegen.png)
<br>Now lets break down how to generate a code with this website.
## Hex Codes
The hex codes text feild is where colors that are globally used across all versions of photop. Each one of those hex codes means something to the website. It is important to set these values, otherwise it would look messed up. Heres what each hex code means in order:
<br> **Scrollbar Color
<br> Background Color
<br> Miscellaneous #1
<br> Miscellaneous #2
<br> Miscellaneous #3
<br> Border Color
<br> Font Color
<br> And *finally*, Theme Color**
<br> To make the code generate properly, you need a hex code, and then a comma for each of the 8 hex codes. If you set these hex codes to the right values, the website can look great! Now moving on to css animation.
## CSS Animation
The CSS animation section is pretty self explanitory, you can use custom css (which includes css animation) in your theme. Theres no special structure like with the hex codes, so it would be an easier task to do than hex codes. Though if you don't know css, then it might be a paint to figure it out. But it will be worth it. Trust me.ã…¤
